# -Eye-Cancer-Prediction
This project leverages advanced ensemble machine learning techniques to predict patient outcomes in eye cancer diagnosis. It processes a real-world healthcare dataset, handles imbalanced data using SMOTE, and applies top-tier classifiers (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) for robust prediction accuracy.
